To impliment JSON reading and writing capabilities, you need to have downloaded Node.js.
Once that is downloaded, you need to make a directory. Within that directory will be were you place the .html and .css files.
Additionally, you will need to place the server.js file in the same root as the directory(not within the directory).

I am running 'nodemon server.js' in the Windows Powershell Administrator terminal.
Make sure to run the following beforehand to be able to use nodemon,
'Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process' [ENTER]
'>>'

Otherwise you can just run
'node server.js'
in the non-Administrator verson of Windows Powershell.

To get to the correct directory in the terminal, make sure you run
'cd [PATH]'
where you replace [PATH] with a copy of your directory's path.

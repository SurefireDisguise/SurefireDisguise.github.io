        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This is my capstone project for my final semester at NSU, Habit Forge. 
            If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me 
            through my school email; mg3091@mynsu.nova.edu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary objective of this project is to develop HabitForge, 
            an interactive website enabling users to systematically track and analyze 
            their habits. By establishing a habit-tracking routine, users can cultivate 
            positive behaviors, overcome detrimental habits, and achieve meaningful 
            personal growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            HabitForge caters to a diverse audience of individuals aspiring to enhance 
            their daily routines, establish positive habits, and accomplish personal 
            goals. It is designed for those keen on personal development and 
            self-improvement, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
